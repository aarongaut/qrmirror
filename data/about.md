# QR Mirror

This site can be used to link a QR code to a short message. The full content of the message is encoded in the URL pointed to by the QR code, so nothing is stored server-side.

## Usage

Give it a try by changing the text below and hitting *Go!*. If you scan the resulting QR code it will link back to the same page. This can be used, for example, to transfer text from your PC to phone.

## Formatting

You can use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for *rich* **text** formatting. To prevent formatting, you can wrap the message in triple backticks (```).
